# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights

1. Seasonal Trends

    Bike rentals peak during summer and decline in winter, indicating a strong seasonal impact on demand.

2. Weather Influence

    Higher temperatures correlate with increased bike usage, while high humidity and heavy rainfall negatively impact rentals.
    
    Weekday vs. Weekend Usage
    
    Weekday rentals are higher during morning and evening hours, suggesting commuter usage, whereas weekends see a more balanced distribution.
    
    Holiday & Working Day Impact
    
    Bike usage is significantly lower on holidays compared to regular working days, showing reliance on bike rentals for daily commuting.
